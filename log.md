# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: Octobers 22, 2019 

**Today's Progress:** Worked on Section 3 of the **Complete Python Bootcamp**. Learned about basic arithmetic, variable naming conventions and reassigning variables.

**Thoughts:** I wasn't able to complete as much as I wanted but the whole point is to pace myself to learn with understanding. I want to seriously learn Python (and not get stuck at dictionaries again).

**Link to work:** N/A
