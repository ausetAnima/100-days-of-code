# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: January 17, 2020

**Today's Progress:** Finished Powershell introduction in  **The Modern 3 Python Bootcamp - Section 3**. Completed Section 5&6 to review Python Setup and Numbers, Operators and Comments. Reorganized my Notion workspace pages to fit the order of the sections. Downloaded Github Desktop so I don't have to rely on the browser based Github.

**Thoughts:** So this is my third time doing the 100 Days of Code. I feel like I let life depression and that good old imposter syndrome get me down constantly. I will make it through this round. Whne I'm done, I will be a Python Extradinare.

**Link to work:** N/A
